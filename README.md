# freezctl
This is a simple python program meant to run on a Raspberry pi. This program utilizes GPIO Pins 3, 5,and 7 to trigger a low to high 5v to 115v 3 port relay module needed to control a swamp cooler. This is not a functioning program yet. While running it will cycle through the relay switches correctly, I have not finished coding everything necessary for actual functionality.
