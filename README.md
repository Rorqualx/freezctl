# freezctl
This is a simple python program meant to run on a Raspberry pi. This program utilizes GPIO Pins 4, 5,and 6 to trigger a 5v to 120vac 3 port relay module needed to control a swamp cooler. This is a basic beta version and is functional but my run into bugs. This is a hoby and work in progress and will be updated from time to time.
